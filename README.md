This is a series of utilities to downlaod various files 
from the FCC databases and create a list of currently 
licensed AM band radio stations.

Just clone the repo and type 'make', and you will end up with
a vertical bar delimited file (suitable for loading into your
favorite spreadsheet program) calld 'am.txt' of all the AM band radio stations in the USA.

Other make targets:
> make clean -- Deletes all the generated data files and the downloaded zip files.

> make tidy -- deletes the generated data files.

> make pristine -- deletes everything except the source code files.
